# Speedrun

## Description
Contains timestamped branches defining user stories implemented with specific technologies.

The project's goal is to implement features with maximum speed and completeness, while establishing a benchmark of skill for reference.

## Usage
The best way to use this repository is to start a branch as soon as possible during research. This makes the baseline reflect starting from zero knowledge.

## Limitations
One of the limitations would be the prioritization of speed as a metric above all else.

Ideally, there should be a code quality standard which also improves over time.
